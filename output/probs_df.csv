The suitability of these enzymes for such applications can be assessed on SUMO substrates whose functional and biochemical properties are differentially modulated based on the modifying paralog.,0.9970424771308899,0.0011151536600664258,0.001842391793616116

A similar effect could also be achieved through the use of a chimeric construct that consists of a protein domain that specifically binds the target substrate and a SUMO machinery component that is attached to this protein domain through a linker peptide (Fig.,0.716288685798645,0.10091765969991684,0.18279367685317993

A potential method to manipulate chromatin sumoylation in a locus-specific manner could be centered around a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) construct that does not possess any nuclease activity (Fig.,0.9797429442405701,0.007637208327651024,0.012619862332940102
