Discovery of SUMO
Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a highly conserved, ubiquitin-like small protein that can be attached to protein substrates to increase the functional repertoire of the eukaryotic proteome. The SUMO proteins were discovered independently in a variety of contexts, and their precise role in the cell caused plenty of confusion, mainly due to their multifunctional nature. The earliest paper directly pertaining to sumoylation was published in 1995 by Meluh and Koshland, who stumbled upon the sole SUMO gene (SMT3) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae while conducting a genetic screen for suppressors of MIF2, a centromeric protein [[1]]. Not suspecting the future simplications of their discovery, the authors merely went on to characterize the MIF2 gene, known back then to be essential for cell division. Only a year later, three independent studies identified human SUMO in different settings, all reporting similarities to ubiquitin, as well as to yeast SMT3. Shen et al. [[2]], interested in the RAD51/RAD52-mediated DNA repair pathway, identified human SUMO as a novel interaction partner of both RAD51 and RAD52 proteins and named it ubiquitin-like protein 1 (Ubl1). Okura et al. [[3]] were studying extrinsic apoptotic pathways and identified SUMO as a novel binding partner to both FAS and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor. As this new protein protected the cell from FAS/TNF-induced cell death, the authors named it “Sentrin”, after a video game character called Sentry the Guardian. Boddy et al., interested in fishing out proteins associated with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs), identified SUMO as the first PML NB-associated protein that interacts with PML [[4]]. Here, the small protein was christened PIC1 (for PML-interacting clone).

Identification of SUMO as a post-translational modifier
While SUMO was initially identified as predominantly a binding partner for nuclear proteins, later evidence from Michael Matunis (Günter Blobel’s laboratory) and Frauke Melchior (Larry Gerace’s laboratory) indicated that it covalently attaches to its targets to serve as a post-translational modification (PTM) [[5, 6]]. This key finding was uncovered while investigating the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the mechanisms of nuclear protein import. According to the model put forth by several groups, movement through the NPC is driven by a gradient of two different conformational forms of Ran, a small GTP-binding protein [[7]]. GTP-Ran is enriched on the nuclear face of the NPC where it helps unload the cargo from nuclear import receptors. On the cytosolic side, however, the predominating Ran form is GDP-Ran due to the activity of the GTP-hydrolyzing Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) protein. Though unmodified RanGAP1 is cytosolic and diffuse, the SUMO-modified RanGAP1 is tethered onto the NPC via interaction with a nucleoporin called RanBP2, which further protects RanGAP1 from sentrin-specific protease (SENP)-mediated desumoylation (see below) [[6, 8, 9]]. Our current knowledge of sumoylation as a covalent modification dates back to these early studies on nuclear transport, which also provided initial clues on the distinct biochemical functions of this ubiquitin-like modification, especially those pertaining to subcellular target localization. Today, we know that under normal physiological conditions, RanGAP1 constitutes the major cellular reservoir for the limited amount of SUMO1, from where the modifier can be dynamically mobilized to be conjugated onto other targets as needed. This might explain why this PTM was initially characterized on RanGAP1, among a few other proteins.

The first clinical link
Today, we know that a key feature of sumoylation is its association with PML NBs, membrane-less subnuclear compartments organized by PML protein where specific enrichment of many SUMO-modified client proteins can be observed [[10, 11]]. These fascinating structures serve as a stopping point for many functionally distinct proteins, including the master transcriptional factor p53 and its regulators, through which they can modulate cellular homeostasis and stress response [[12, 13]]. Originally discovered by electron microscopy in 1960s, PML NBs regained attention in the early 90s after scientists observed that a rare yet aggressive type of cancer called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) presented with disruption of these structures [[14-16]]. APL was initially characterized in 1957 by Hillestad [[17]] and is defined by the unique chromosomal translocation t(15:17) [[18, 19]]. Subsequent studies led to the discovery of the PML gene at this breakage site [[20-22]], generating the PML/retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) fusion oncoprotein that we now know interferes with PML NB formation and its downstream signaling pathways.

Having received an initial momentum with these early studies, the field of APL research has expanded ever since, and its path has crossed with that of the SUMO field on various occasions. Today, APL is widely considered to be a prototypical paragon of precision medicine, wherein our detailed understanding of the pathogenesis is matched by an equally delineated description of the operational mechanisms underlying the cure [[16, 23]]. Intriguingly, both the pathogeny and the cure of APL rely on SUMO. Sumoylation of the driver oncoprotein PML/RARα is necessary for cellular transformation [[24]], whereas hyper-sumoylation of PML/RARα precipitates its targeted destruction at the proteasome [[25-27]]. This latter pathway, which is engaged by the curative combination therapy consisting of arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid, leads to the eradication of APL blasts in over 95% of cases in a clear display of oncogene addiction. In the nonpathological state, the PML and SUMO proteins exist in a state of reciprocal regulation. SUMO heavily modifies PML, and in turn, PML facilitates the sumoylation of a large number of critical proteins by concentrating them into NBs where it serves as the scaffold [[28]]. The relationship between PML and SUMO will be further explored in the following paragraphs when we discuss two emerging fields of study: en masse sumoylation of protein complexes and SUMO-induced protein destruction. In addition, as the pathological and potentially therapeutic roles of SUMO extend far beyond APL, we will discuss how continuous discoveries uncovering SUMO’s participation in an immense range of cellular mechanisms inform our perspective on numerous unrelated disorders, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and infection.

Discovery of UBC9 and early functional studies
The SUMO conjugation cascade flows similarly to the ubiquitylation cascade, in that SUMO attachment is implemented via the activities of E1 (activating), E2 (conjugating), and E3 (ligase) enzymes (Fig. 1). The central component of this machinery is the universal SUMO conjugase UBC9, which was also initially characterized in yeast [[29]]. Studying ubiquitin-mediated cyclin degradation, the Jentsch laboratory noted that depletion of this newly identified ‘ubiquitin’ conjugating enzyme impeded cell cycle progression. The human homolog of yeast UBC9 was identified a year later by the very team that co-discovered human SUMO, once again during their studies on RAD51/RAD52-mediated DNA repair [[30]]. The authors were employing a yeast two-hybrid system using human RAD52 as bait in their search for novel players of this repair pathway when they fished out human UBC9 [(named ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 I (UBE2I)] as an interactor. Furthermore, they opened a can of worms by providing the initial clues of p53 sumoylation, with data indicating that UBE2I interacts also with this major tumor suppressor. Since then, much has been learned about the mechanisms that control the sumoylation of p53 and its partners, yet the significance of this particular modification in tumorigenesis is still unclear and actively being investigated.

The SUMO (de)conjugation pathway and consequences of sumoylation. The SUMO protein is processed by a protease to expose a diglycine (–GG) residue, yielding the mature peptide. The mature SUMO is attached to a heterodimeric E1 complex (SAE1/UBA2), which in turn catalyzes the transfer of the peptide onto the central E2 enzyme (UBC9). The E2 enzyme then may directly catalyze the attachment of SUMO to the substrate (not shown) or alternatively may recruit an additional E3 enzyme to confer further substrate specificity. SUMO deconjugation can then be catalyzed by SUMO proteases, rendering sumoylation a reversible modification. As depicted, sumoylation results in biochemical alterations on its substrate, which in turn may affect cellular and physiological processes, eventually contributing to health and disease states.
Shortly after the discovery of UBC9, four groups independently provided the biochemical evidence for its role as a SUMO conjugase [[31-34]]. A few years later, two back-to-back stories by the groups of Ronald Hay and Giannino del Sal independently corroborated p53 sumoylation [[35, 36]]. While the consequences of this modification were not completely clear at that point, the nascent SUMO literature suggested that, in contrast to ubiquitylation, sumoylation did not induce protein degradation, but served to alter other properties such as subcellular localization, as in the case of RanGAP1 [[5, 6]]. Furthermore, another report had proposed a model where NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (IκBα) sumoylation competed with its ubiquitylation for the same residue to enhance its stability [[37]]. Consistent with these results, the authors concluded that the sumoylation of p53 did not trigger its degradation, but enhanced its transcriptional activity. Nevertheless, extrapolating this conclusion to other transcription factors proved difficult, as a subsequent report pointed out that SUMO conjugation to c-JUN appeared to suppress its transactivation potential [[38]]. Later studies also discarded the notion that SUMO was purely antagonistic to ubiquitin, as sumoylation was found to trigger the recruitment of a specific class of ubiquitin ligases to induce ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Indeed, after continuous discoveries of proteins undergoing SUMO-dependent ubiquitin modification, poly-sumoylation seemed mainly as ancillary to ubiquitylation.

Biochemical and structural characterization of the SUMO pathway
Despite its similarities and overlapping functions with ubiquitylation, the sumoylation process has special features that set it apart, and its functional capabilities extend far beyond providing an additional upstream layer of regulation and complexity for proteasomal degradation. Unlike ubiquitin, which relies on a host of E2 and E3 enzymes to interact with its targets, SUMO has a much more limited enzymatic toolkit to work with, where many components serve as pleiotropic regulatory points. The initial step of the cascade involves the ATP-dependent activation of SUMO, and this step is catalyzed by the SAE1/UBA2 heterodimer, which was also discovered by the laboratories of Ronald Hay and Günter Blobel (Fig. 1) [[32, 39, 40]]. The subsequent conjugation step constitutes the absolute convergence point for the machinery, with UBC9 serving as the only E2 enzyme. In addition, UBC9 can also fulfill the ligase function of the sumoylation machinery by directly catalyzing the transfer of SUMO onto the target sumoylation motifs. The essential roles played in the cell by UBC9 (and by extension sumoylation) were uncovered in functional studies. Dieckhoff et al. showed that the deletion of UBC9 or the only SUMO gene (SMT3) in S. cerevisiae causes loss of cell viability [[41]]. Nacerddine et al. created a homozygous UBC9 knockout mouse line and observed an embryonic lethal phenotype with blastocysts displaying gross defects in the architectural integrity and organization of the nucleus [[42]]. Importantly, SUMO1-deficient mice and SUMO3-deficient mice are viable due to compensation by the most abundant SUMO family member SUMO2 [[43-45]]. Notwithstanding the importance and functional versatility of UBC9 as a conjugase and a ligase, there is a diverse repertoire of E3 enzymes, such as the abovementioned RanBP2, that can be recruited to confer further catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity for SUMO attachment.

In parallel to functional studies, many groups also strived to resolve the structures of SUMO machinery components to fully appreciate how they work on a molecular level. The first 3-dimensional NMR structure of SUMO1 was presented shortly after its discovery [[46]] and revealed substantial similarities to ubiquitin [[47, 48]]. According to this, although SUMO shares only 18% amino acid sequence identity with ubiquitin, the global structures of the two peptides are remarkably similar. Both SUMO and ubiquitin feature the classical “ββαββαβ” ubiquitin fold, as well as a conserved position for the C-terminal Gly–Gly residues that are required for isopeptide bond formation with the substrate (Fig. 1). In addition, SUMO1 sports a long and flexible N terminus that protrudes from its ubiquitin core. The similarities between these two PTMs extend beyond having analogous enzymatic machineries or structures. Both ubiquitin and SUMO moieties are targeted to the ϵ-amino group on acceptor lysine residue, with SUMO machinery predominantly recognizing lysines that reside within the larger consensus motif of ψKxD/E (where ψ denotes a large hydrophobic residue and x any residue) [[49, 50]]. Over the years, researchers identified many other noncanonical motifs that UBC9 can dock onto, which have recently been discussed in detail in excellent reviews [[51-55]].

The structure of UBC9 and the nature of its interactions with SUMO E3 ligases or target proteins have been explored in elegant studies [[56-62]]. The first X-ray crystal structure of murine UBC9 (identical to human homolog) was published at 2 Å resolution in 1997 [[60]]. Accordingly, UBC9 is a single domain protein, 50% of which is comprised of secondary structures forming what is called a typical Ubc fold. While the SUMO-conjugating activity of UBC9 was unknown at the time, the authors noted significant differences from other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes despite having similar overall tertiary structures [[60]], and the distinctive structural features of UBC9 were confirmed a year later [[59]]. In particular, the architecture of the active site surrounding the catalytic cysteine (Cys93) reflects the specificity of UBC9 for SUMO rather than ubiquitin. Moreover, the unique surface charge distribution of the protein that amounts to a strong overall electrostatic dipole explains its ability to interact with an exceptionally wide variety of proteins, including the E1 enzyme. The N-terminal region of UBC9 was also reported to be important for noncovalent interactions with SUMO paralogs and for receiving the SUMO1 moiety from E1 [[57, 63]]. In 2002, Chris Lima’s group unveiled the first-ever structure of an E2 UBC in complex with a substrate by docking UBC9 onto RanGAP1 [[62]]. This complex revealed a unique platform on the UBC9 catalytic site that participates in electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding with the RanGAP1 acceptor lysine. Another observation was the formation of additional interactions between RanGAP1 and UBC9 that extend beyond those around the consensus sumoylation motif. Shortly thereafter, similar interactions were reported in NMR structural studies that employed peptide particles carrying p53 and c-JUN SUMO conjugation sites [[58]].

A number of ubiquitin E2 enzymes can bind members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ligases, which facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin moieties onto substrates by bridging them with the ubiquitin-E2 complex [[64]]. Upon dimerization, TRIM proteins interact with an E2 through their really interesting new gene (RING) domains [[65-67]]. Interestingly, aside from being a SUMO substrate, PML is also a TRIM protein whose RING domain interacts only with UBC9 rather than with a ubiquitin E2 enzyme [[68]]. While other E3 RINGs are known to form dimers, a high-resolution crystal structure revealed that the PML RING domain forms a tetrameric torus, ensuring efficient UBC9 recruitment and PML sumoylation [[69]]. Thus, evolutionary processes have produced multiple modalities of UBC9-substrate interactions, likely to accommodate the plethora of substrates with unrelated functions that all rely on this unique E2 enzyme for modification.

SUMO paralogs and chain formation
Once conjugated to their targets, both ubiquitin and SUMO can form extensive polypeptide chains thanks to the presence of suitable motifs on both modifiers. Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues that can themselves be ubiquitylated to form distinct branching patterns with different functions [[70]]. In the late 90s, novel SUMO-encoding genes were identified in both human and mouse genomes, and researchers quickly noted the functional heterogeneity between their products. Of the 5 SUMO paralogs in the human genome identified to date, only SUMO2 and SUMO3 (which have 97% peptide sequence similarity and are collectively referred to as SUMO2/3) appeared to carry an internal SUMO consensus motif, enabling the creation of topologically uniform poly-SUMO chains via iterative linkages on K11 [[71]]. SUMO1, on the other hand, was thought to participate in these chains solely as a terminal cap to preclude further elongation [[72]]. However, this classical model of chain formation is being superseded by a newer understanding in light of more recent findings. A proteomic analysis of more than 4000 sumoylation sites in HeLa cells indicated that other internal lysine residues could also engage in chain formation [[73]], even permitting branching [[74]]. An inverted sumoylation motif on SUMO1 (centering on K7) was also found to promote chain formation [[75, 76]]. Hendriks et al. [[76]] recently carried out a large-scale proteomic analysis coupled with a peptide-level immuno-enrichment strategy to map more than 14 000 endogenous SUMO2/3 target sites in human cells and also pinpointed nearly 2000 sites in mouse tissues. Investigation of the endogenous SUMO chain topology in human cells indicated that in addition to K11 on SUMO2/3, K7, K21 and K33 could all significantly engage in chain formation and that SUMO1 was also modified on K7. Interestingly, the authors found that other lysine residues on SUMO1 were modified by SUMO2/3 under stress conditions. Indeed, in human cells exposed to stress or in mouse tissues, the degree of modification of these individual sites was visibly different, hinting at the existence of regulatory mechanisms that control SUMO chain topology [[76]]. Finally, chain formation may also be affected by phosphorylation or acetylation of the SUMO proteins themselves, further increasing the signaling complexity and versatility [[74, 77]].

As of 2020, the field still has limited insight into the role of poly-SUMO chains. Poly-sumoylation, as well as multi-sumoylation (sumoylation of multiple lysines on a given target surface), can create a unique topology that can further be recognized by certain SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligases (STUbL), which can initiate proteolytic or nonproteolytic ubiquitylation of the substrate. Indeed, mixed SUMO-ubiquitin chains can be formed through ubiquitylation of SUMO and vice versa [[74]]. As described above, SUMO1 is mostly found in conjugates and can preferentially modify certain high-affinity substrates, with RanGAP1 being the most notable example. Accordingly, the in vivo quantity of free SUMO1 peptides seems to be limiting. On the other hand, a relatively abundant pool of unconjugated SUMO2/3 is maintained in the cells and can be mobilized onto targets massively in response to protein-damaging stresses such as heat shock [[78-80]]. As hinted above, the advent of novel SUMO purification technologies, coupled with highly sensitive detection methods, allowed proteome-wide tracking of SUMO2/3 conjugation and chain formation. For example, both SUMO2 and SUMO3 were shown to be essential in helping cells to survive through hyperthermic stress by forming polymeric conjugates on a wide variety of proteins that function in critical cellular activities that involve folding, degradation, transcription, translation, apoptosis, cell cycle [[81]]. In line with a physiological role for SUMO chains in fighting cytopathic insults, a chain-interactor STUbL called RING finger protein 4 (RNF4) was shown to mediate an efficient cellular response to genotoxic stress and DNA damage [[82]]. Intriguingly, the ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11), a known component of the DNA damage response, was suggested to counteract and balance RNF4 action by deubiquitylating hybrid SUMO-ubiqutin chains [[83]]. A recent study by Alfred Vertegaal’s group also demonstrated the pervasiveness of SUMO chain formation in the cell by knocking down the poly-SUMO chain eraser SENP6. This allowed them to identify numerous poly-SUMO substrates, among which was a highly interconnected network of proteins including the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) subunits, several DNA damage response factors, and the NB organizer PML [[84]]. A similar proteomic profiling study conducted by Stefan Müller corroborated a role for SENP6 and poly-sumoylation both at the centromere and in orchestrating DNA damage response [[85]].

In contrast to these well-characterized paralogs, SUMO4 and SUMO5 may have more obscure functions that largely remain enigmatic. SUMO4 was initially discovered in genetic fine-mapping studies where a M55V substitution on this novel protein was strongly associated with type 1 diabetes [[86, 87]]. While SUMOs 1–3 are widely expressed in human tissues, SUMO4 expression is restricted to kidney, spleen, placenta and lymph nodes [[86, 88, 89]]. The authors also suggested that SUMO4 could negatively regulate NFκB signaling, possibly by modifying IκBα [[86]]. On the other hand, SUMO4 contains a unique C-terminal proline residue (P90, instead of a glutamine) that impairs its SENP-mediated maturation, which would preclude its covalent attachment to substrates via an isopeptide bond [[90]]. Further studies are still needed to shed light on the basic biology of SUMO4, to investigate its potential functions as a noncovalent interactor (rather than a modifier) as previously suggested for SUMO1 [[91]], and to better characterize its roles in diabetes susceptibility [[92]]. SUMO5 is a recently discovered paralog whose expression is also restricted to specific tissues such as testes and peripheral blood leukocytes, where it may regulate PML NB formation and stability [[93]].

The role of SUMO-interacting motifs
Another mysterious aspect of sumoylation is the commonly observed phenomenon of preferential attachment of a particular SUMO paralog to a given lysine residue. While still poorly understood, a first clue on how paralog-specific conjugation could occur on targets came from studies by Ronald Hay in 2005. The authors showed that RanBP2, which displays an E3 ligase activity for a set of substrates including SP100 and PML, contained a specific binding site for SUMO1, but not SUMO2. This would help with the recruitment of SUMO1-loaded UBC9 to form a SUMO1-E2, E3-substrate complex, selectively conjugating the latter with SUMO1 [[61]]. Another source of paralog-specific modification is the presence of multiple SENP family members (see below) that can preferentially remove SUMO1 or SUMO2/3, making way for modification of the sumoylation motif by the other paralogs [[94, 95]]. Finally, hydrophobic stretches called SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), which normally mediate noncovalent interactions with SUMO-modified substrates [[96]], may also facilitate interactions with UBC9 carrying a particular SUMO paralog under certain circumstances, leading to the isoform-specific modification of the SIM-bearing protein. This was reported to be the case for the ubiquitin-specific protease USP25, which carries a seven-amino-acid-long SIM that is required for its selective modification by SUMO2/3 [[97]]. Preferential modification of BLM by SUMO2/3 is also mediated by analogous noncovalent SUMO-SIM interactions [[98]]. Finally, a recent study showed that CRISPR-mediated deletion of a zinc finger protein called ZNF451, which also partially localizes to PML NBs, markedly impaired stress-induced global SUMO2/3 chain conjugation [[99]]. ZNF451 seems to be a SUMO2/3-specific E3 ligase, which also possesses an E4 ‘chain elongase’ activity. These activities are facilitated by a tandem SIM motif on the protein. While the first SIM binds the donor SUMO2 that is preloaded onto UBC9 and facilitates its discharge onto the substrate, the second SIM binds a scaffold SUMO on the backside of UBC9, which serves to stabilize the complex for efficient chain elongation.

In addition to regulating paralog-specific conjugation, SIMs enhance functional interactions of sumoylated proteins, thereby modulating downstream signaling events or cellular stress responses. Notably, STUbLs utilize SIMs to interact with their SUMO-conjugated substrates. The heterodimeric S. cerevisiae STUbL Slx5-Slx8 can localize to stalled replication forks, to DNA damage-induced foci or to double-strand breaks (DSBs) where an abundance of sumoylated conjugates has been observed. Slx5–Slx8 may induce ubiquitylation and proteasomal targeting to limit uncontrolled accumulation of sumoylated proteins, which might otherwise lead to cell cycle arrest [[100, 101]]. In line with this idea and as mentioned above, the mammalian STUbL RNF4 has recently emerged as a key mediator of cellular genotoxic stress responses and a component of DNA repair foci where it likely mediates efficient clearance of DNA damage factors and checkpoint proteins such as MDC1 [[82]]. In addition to mediating DNA repair and progression through cell cycle, STUbLs also function in a variety of cellular events and signal transduction pathways. These range from transcriptional regulation via interactions with sumoylated transcription factors and steroid hormone receptors [[101, 102]] to modulation of chemotaxis in Dictyostelium by ubiquitylating the components of the MAP kinase signaling pathway [[103]]. Critically, STUbLs may also mediate nonproteolytic ubiquitylation of the substrates, expanding the functional consequences of SIM/SUMO interactions. For example, RNF111/Arkadia is a recently identified STUbL, which couples sumoylation of XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum C) with its nonproteolytic ubiquitylation during UV-induced nucleotide excision repair [[104]].

Because SIMs have been uncovered in a large number of proteins other than STUbLs, the signaling capacity of SIM/SUMO interactions is likely diverse. A classic example concerns silencing of neural-specific gene expression in non-neuronal cells by the CoREST1/LSD1/histone deacetylase (HDAC) corepressor complex. A SIM on CoREST1 mediates the recruitment of this complex to the promoter regions that are preoccupied with SUMO2/3-modified transcription factors or other chromatin-associated proteins [[105]]. In this case, an intact CoREST1 SIM is required for stable binding of CoREST1 to the promoters as well as transcriptional repression of target genes. Finally, SIMs can act as homing signals that drive client proteins into PML NBs where further PTMs are initiated to orchestrate downstream stress responses (see below) [[28]].

SUMO proteases
At the termination point of the sumoylation cascade, the modified product is free to exert its newly acquired functions, until another regulated process called desumoylation steps in (Fig. 1). Desumoylation entails the removal of SUMO residues by a distinct set of catalysts called SENPs. Similar to many other components that we touched upon, SENPs were initially described in S. cerevisiae as ubiquitin-like-specific protease 1 and 2 (ULP1 and ULP2) [[106, 107]]. The human genome encodes six distinct SENP family members (SENP1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7) that act as SUMO erasers [[94]]. Strikingly, SENP1, SENP2, SENP3, and SENP5 also feature much earlier in the sumoylation cascade as prerequisite processing enzymes for SUMO maturation, where they cleave the C-terminal portion of the small protein to expose a diglycine motif and thereby render it ready for ligation via isopeptide bond formation. Similar to the enzymatic attachment cascade, the SENP-mediated desumoylation process is also remarkable in its ability to modulate the modification status of thousands of substrates with a significant degree of specificity despite having few enzymes to work with. In addition, a particular SENP family member can display an inherent preference for the detachment of a specific SUMO paralog. This implies that interaction with different SENPs can portend different fates for substrates, hinting at the presence of precise regulatory mechanisms controlling SENP activity. An insight into how the seemingly promiscuous substrate selectivity of SENPs may be specified came from Jentsch and Psakhye’s group modification concept (see below) [[108, 109]]. According to this, in eukaryotic cells, particular sumoylation machinery components can remain in association with large groups of protein interactors that frequently constitute functional networks, which enables them to attain target specificity via spatial compartmentalization. This concept was recently epitomized in the discovery of SENP6-mediated de-modification of a group of 180 proteins, including those that belong to a CCAN [[84]]. The localization of SENPs to specific subcellular compartments is achieved via intermolecular interactions mediated by their N-terminal regions. For instance, SENP1 is a predominantly nuclear protease due to the presence of an N-terminal nuclear localization signal, the mutation of which results in cytoplasmic accumulation [[110]]. Similarly, mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of SENP3 N-terminal serine/threonine residues facilitates interaction with NPM1, explaining the nucleolar localization of this protease [[111]]. Alternative splicing of the SENP2 N terminus produces three variants with differing lengths, each of which has a distinct localization pattern, namely the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex, cytoplasm, and the PML NBs [[112-114]]. Furthermore, the SUMO paralog specificity of the SENP family members may also be conferred by their N-terminal sequences [[115]].

Multiple SENP family members are known to localize to PML NBs, where they exert their effects by hydrolyzing SUMO proteins on either PML NBs or their client proteins. As PML NBs serve as focal points of global sumoylation, the association of SENPs with these structures provides an opportunity for en masse targeting of the nuclear SUMOylome both through PML disruption and client de-modification. The SENP2 N-terminal splicing variant SuPr-1 selectively reverses SUMO1 modification of PML, leading to altered localization of both PML and the PML NB clients death domain-associated protein (DAXX) and CREB-binding protein (CBP) [[114]]. SENP6 and SENP7 are known to target SUMO2/3 polymerization on PML NBs, and their depletion leads to a concomitant increase in both the size and the number of NBs [[116]] [[117, 118]]. At least in the case of SENP6, this increase seems to be accompanied by an accumulation of SUMO2/3-modified substrates within the NBs, indicating that this protease may also be critical for the deconjugation of poly-SUMO chains on PML NB clients [[116]].

Both through their association with PML NBs and direct activity on numerous transcription factors, SENPs are involved in the regulation of a broad array of genes including proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. The mechanistic roles played by SENPs in the development of human cancers reflect the importance of sumoylation in oncogenesis [[119, 120]]. Androgen receptor (AR) is the key oncogenic factor and a pivotal therapeutic target in prostate cancer, and the sumoylation of the AR N-terminal tail leads to the attenuation of its transcription factor activity [[121-123]]. The Yeh group’s histological studies revealed overexpression of SENP1 in human prostate cancer samples, and subsequent molecular studies by them noted that this leads to the upregulation of cyclin D1 and the enhancement of AR and c-JUN transcriptional activity [[124]]. Interestingly, the effect of SENP1 on AR was due to the desumoylation of the upstream regulatory factor HDAC1 and not AR itself. Another group proposed the use of urine SENP1 mRNA levels as a biomarker to predict bladder cancer recurrence [[125]]. Along the same lines, increased SENP1 expression was found to be correlated with higher tumor grade and poor prognosis in both prostate cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma [[126, 127]]. However, mouse studies by the Yeh group painted a more nuanced picture, where SENP1 can also play tumor-suppressive roles in prostate cancer by desumoylating phosphatase and tensin homolog and protecting it from poly-ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation [[128]]. Cell culture-based experiments by other groups demonstrated that the sumoylated c-MYC oncoprotein levels are sensitive to SENP7 knockdown, and SENP1 can directly bind to c-MYC to desumoylate and stabilize it [[129, 130]]. Collectively, SENPs play diverse roles in oncogenesis and tumor progression, the exact nature of which depends on the activities of their SUMO-modified substrates.

Emerging concepts in sumoylation
So far, we have discussed the milestones in the history of the SUMO field (Fig. 2), as well as the distinct features that set sumoylation apart from other PTMs, such as paralog diversity and specificity in attachment and detachment, which are catalyzed by a limited set of enzymes. Beyond these unique properties, SUMO’s importance in the cell is becoming more and more apparent as we discover novel substrates that are critical for health and disease. In our opinion, as we approach the 25th birthday of the SUMO field, the major physiologically and clinically relevant concepts arising from these discoveries are pertaining to SUMO’s roles in regulating epigenetics, cell identity, pathogenic protein stability, as well as its ability to target entire protein complexes with higher-order consequences. In the following sections, we discuss this emerging knowledge and the current state of the art regarding the potential of sumoylation as a target process that can be manipulated with therapeutic benefits.

Major milestones in the SUMO field. The seminal discoveries of SMT3 and UBC9 in yeast laid the groundwork for the biochemical and functional characterization of the SUMO pathway. In parallel, the curative effect of As2O3 in APL and the mechanistic basis of this therapy highlighted the clinical potential of SUMO. Later studies led to the characterization of SUMO as a dynamic and reversible modification that is essential for life. The importance of this PTM is evident not only from its substrate repertoire, which includes key targets such as p53 and histones but also from its regulatory roles in other essential processes, such as ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. The protein group sumoylation concept may explain how this reversible PTM wields significant influence over global cellular processes while modifying only a modest fraction of its target pool. Studies aiming to elucidate how SUMO exerts its large- and small-scale effects benefit from the advent of novel methods for the detection and characterization of sumoylation. Specific inhibitors of the SUMO pathway abolish global sumoylation, which helps us uncover the functional consequences of sumoylation while holding therapeutic promise due to SUMO’s involvement in a multitude of pathogenic processes.
En masse sumoylation of protein groups
Both the diversity of SUMO-regulated cellular phenomena and the detrimental consequences of its abrogation clearly state that sumoylation is a fundamentally important PTM for cells. In line with this, the list of SUMO-conjugated substrates is growing rapidly. A seemingly counterintuitive observation has been that aside from a few “outlier” targets such as PML and RanGAP1, SUMO modifies a small fraction of most target proteins, especially in unstressed cells. This is most likely due to rapid deconjugation by SENPs shifting the equilibrium to the side of the unmodified form. Despite this, a maximal downstream response can be achieved, whether that be repression of transcription or DNA damage repair. Several models have been proposed to explain this “big, quantitative effect” driven by a “small population”. One explanation is the persistence of sumoylation-mediated effects. An initial burst of sumoylation may modify a large fraction of a target pool and serve to recruit additional PTMs, such as poly-ubiquitin chains, which remain on the substrate even after the SUMOs are cleaved off. In addition, sumoylation could permanently force-drive and lock the substrate into a functional complex or a subcellular compartment where the protein resides even after deconjugation. Thus, the modification occurs reversibly (which would explain the low detectable levels of sumoylation at a given time), albeit with persistent effects. Another explanation is that the whole pool of a given substrate may be modified over time, with cumulative downstream effects [[51, 131, 132]].

Alternatively, the sumoylation machinery may only engage a functionally primed pool of a given protein within a complex. An emerging view in the field is that functionally and physically linked proteins may be subjected to sumoylation as a whole group by a topologically connected ligase [[108, 133]]. This observation is fundamentally different from ubiquitylation where a specific E3 ligase modifies an individual protein in a highly restricted and selective manner. Processes that require synchronous and concerted action by multiple components in a given assembly, such as DNA damage repair, transcription, and chromatin remodeling, may particularly be affected by sumoylation en masse. In S. cerevisiae, DNA damage triggers the collective and synchronous sumoylation of multiple proteins that mediate DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR) [[109, 134]]. Yeast harboring mutations in the sumoylation pathway are exclusively sensitive to assaults that induce DSBs, yet abrogating SUMO acceptor sites on individual HR proteins results only in mild phenotypes. This suggests that modified proteins in the HR complex act in a concerted action where the effect of the sumoylation of each component adds up synergistically [[108]]. In this particular example, group sumoylation is mediated by the DNA bound SUMO ligase SIZ2 (of PIAS family) which imposes ‘topological specificity’ on its targets. In this model, the complex may further be stabilized by SUMO acting as a glue, holding the components together through intermolecular SUMO-SIM interactions. In addition to HR, nucleotide excision repair (NER) also benefits from collective sumoylation of its effector components, which are recruited to UV-induced bulky lesions on DNA [[135]]. Multiple NER proteins, particularly RAD16, but also RAD1, 3, 4, 7, 10, and others are sumoylated when S. cerevisiae are exposed to UV. Thus, DNA DSBs or bulky lesions display a tendency to rapidly transform into hot spots of high sumoylation activity. This key feature of sumoylation, that it associates with certain hot spots or hubs, is readily observable at various nuclear sites or assemblies, including damage-induced DNA foci, telomeres, the nucleolus, and PML NBs [[108]].

According to our current understanding, PML NBs are nucleated mainly in response to cellular oxidative stress and the consequent formation of disulfide linkages between the constituent cysteine-rich PML proteins [[11, 28, 136]]. Following this nucleation event, PML multimers recruit UBC9 and become sumoylated on three different lysine residues (K65, K160, and K490) [[11, 69]]. Each PML partner protein carries a SIM that is instrumental in mediating its interactions with SUMO-modified PML. The end result of these reciprocal interactions is the recruitment of the partners into the PML NB inner core, where the resident SUMO machinery drives their hyper-sumoylation en masse [[28]]. The PML proteins thus serve as redox detectors by self-organizing into NBs in response to natural or pharmacologically induced oxidative stress. Consequently, the activity of hundreds of partners can be modulated, including transcription factors or tumor suppressors by these phase-separated, entropically closed structures [[137]]. This phenomenon is perhaps best epitomized by p53 signaling. p53 and many of its key regulatory enzymes including MDM2, HIPK2, MOZ, and CBP are localized to PML NBs, and p53 is a downstream effector of PML-regulated senescence, in particular upon oncogene assault [[11, 138]]. In APL, therapy-induced PML NB reformation initiates p53 activation, and a subsequent p53-dependent senescence response drives eradication of leukemic cells [[139]]. This PML/p53/senescence axis is likely finely tuned by the collective and simultaneous modification of p53 and its modulators in situ in PML NBs [[140]]. In addition to exerting control over p53 signaling or redox homeostasis, PML NBs are now emerging as a focal point for multiple stress response pathways including hypoxia, DNA damage response, and nutrient stress response, through recruitment of relevant proteins and their functional interactors [[12, 141]]. This principle of controlling critical signaling molecules by manipulating the formation of PML NBs underlies the rationale of current and potential therapies [[11, 13]]. The sumoylation of PML NB partners in situ is often followed by their degradation following ubiquitylation by RNF4. The druggable nature of NB biogenesis and partner recruitment thus presents with the opportunity to funnel undesired proteins into this PML/SUMO/RNF4 vortex for destruction and clearance from cells. NB biogenesis is exquisitely sensitive to oxidants, such as arsenic or nonarsenicals. Interferons (IFNs) also promote NB-facilitated sumoylation by inducing PML transcription, by increasing SUMO availability and creating oxidative stress [[142]]. Indeed, PML-, SUMO-, and RNF4-dependent degradation of the Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) TAX oncoprotein underlies clinical responses to the arsenic/IFN combination in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) patients [[143-145]].

All in all, the traditional view of a PTM mediated by a large number of enzymes acting with high substrate selectivity is being revisited after the observation that a small number of sumoylation enzymes impact on a large group of proteins that are linked functionally and topologically. Novel tools and mass spectrometry protocols are being developed to catalog such groups that are collectively subjected to sumoylation, either in PML NBs or in other hot spots, especially in response to cell stress or to a given signal [[133, 146]]. Considering the complexity of any signaling network, such as that of p53, systems biology approaches may also prove useful in deciphering the impact of sumoylation on the overall system.

SUMO as a key designer of epigenetic landscape and a major determinant of pluripotency
Sumoylation in chromatin remodeling
The initial discoveries of SUMO’s roles in isolated intranuclear processes that we discussed in the sections above soon extended to include regulation and oversight of the broader chromatin landscape. Aside from modifying isolated transcription factors and proteins that maintain nuclear integrity, SUMO modification can also implement heritable changes in global gene expression patterns through its involvement in chromatin remodeling. Many other PTMs such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation have been known to modify specific histone subtypes on determinate sites within their N-terminal tails, which effectively alters transcriptional status by modulating the interactions of these proteins with DNA or remodeling complexes. The resultant “histone code”, which proposes to map each modification onto a particular functional outcome, was later found to include sumoylation [[147]]. Based on the initial findings obtained in cell culture experiments, the authors proposed that the H4 histone sumoylation led to transcriptional repression by enabling the recruitment of a HDAC and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Almost a decade later, Maison et al. [[148, 149]] showed that HP1α itself, one of the three human HP1 paralogs, gets sumoylated as a prerequisite event for its de novo recruitment to pericentric chromatin, with the methyltransferase Suv39h1 acting as a SUMO E3 ligase. Other studies also corroborated the repressive roles played by SUMO. Work by Shin et al. [[150]] demonstrated that SUMO (SMT3) in fission yeast is essential for maintaining heterochromatin stability in regions such as the silent mating-type locus as well as the pericentric heterochromatin, where it acts through the modification of the heterochromatin proteins SWI6 and CLR4. Another study in human cell lines showed that sumoylation of the transcription factor SP3 induces the recruitment of SETDB1 and HP1, resulting in histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9Me3) at reporter genes [[151]].

H3K9Me3 is one of the most prolific histone modifications associated with silencing, enriched in constitutive heterochromatin, especially in centromeric and telomeric repeats and transposable elements. Cossec et al. recently identified a role for sumoylation in the maintenance of the H3K9Me3 mark in embryonic stem cells [[152, 153]]. A recent genome-wide study revealed that while SUMO itself is widely distributed over the chromatin, histone promoters, as well as protein biogenesis and tRNA genes, were enriched in active sumoylation markers such as UBC9 and the E3 SUMO ligase PIASy. The enrichment was particularly prominent in senescent cells, where it downregulated the expression of these genes [[154]].

Active sumoylation thus seems to contribute to permanent repression of gene programs in senescent cells by globally targeting the chromatin at critical loci. Nevertheless, SUMO’s roles in governing global chromatin accessibility are likely complex, context-dependent, and extend beyond simply being a repressive mark. Using a unique single-molecule Förster/fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system, Dhall et al. [[155]] observed how frequently nucleosomes bind one another and for how long a dinucleosome stack could survive. The authors suggested that sumoylation of histone 4 at lysine 12 decreased both the formation frequency and lifetime of dinucleosome stacks, leading to diminished chromatin compaction by inhibiting long-range internucleosomal interactions. Another study in cell culture showed that the pharmacological mechanism of HDAC4 inhibition by the chemotherapeutic agent suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) relies on the nuclear localization and sumoylation of this transcription repressing chromatin modifier, eventually leading to its proteasomal degradation [[156]]. Liu et al. [[157]] surveyed the chromatin landscape under nonstress conditions in dividing cells and discovered that SUMO1 localized to the immediately upstream regions of housekeeping genes in a cell cycle-dependent manner. SUMO1 on chromatin was associated with transcriptional activity, and its presence correlated with that of H3K4Me3, an epigenetic marker for active transcription. Strikingly, the silencing of SUMO1 genes resulted in lower transcription rates on predetermined target regions, implying active involvement of this modification in promoting efficient transcriptional activation. Sumoylation and chromatin remodeling both constitute dynamic intracellular response mechanisms that are highly sensitive to extrinsic stressors and therefore proteotoxic stress is a potential convergence point for these two processes. A similar survey by Niskanen et al. [[158]] following heat-shock stimulus revealed enhanced SUMO2/3 localization in the regulatory regions of actively transcribed loci. Interestingly, the modification seemed to be involved in suppressing heat-shock protein gene expression. Seifert et al. investigated how SUMO2 presence after heat stress affects genome-wide expression patterns and identified inconsistent changes in expression patterns. The authors proposed that, rather than directly modulating expression status, SUMO2 modification may serve to stabilize protein complexes that assemble on chromatin in response to stress [[159]]. Collectively, all of these findings indicate discrepant roles for sumoylation that are paralog specific and variable based on contextual cues such as senescence and stress status. As extrinsic and intrinsic conditions can profoundly influence chromatin remodeling and SUMO mobilization, the intersection points of these two processes are likely to be compoundingly labile. Furthermore, long-term inheritable epigenetic changes on chromatin likely involve extensive interactions of SUMO with other dynamic modifications, one finely tuning another over a period of time. This calls for caution when choosing decontextualized cell-based systems to study the roles of sumoylation in epigenetics, especially in disease models. Nevertheless, the picture painted so far is consistent with a model where SUMO is rapidly redistributed along the chromatin template and associated proteins to act as a master response switch under proteotoxic stress conditions in an urgent yet reversible manner.

Alteration of the chromatin landscape via sumoylation appears to be governed in part by the PML NBs. The famous PML NB partner DAXX functions as a histone chaperone and forms a complex with ATRX to regulate the incorporation of histone H3.3 to heterochromatin regions [[160]]. Interestingly, soluble H3.3 is sequestered into the PML NBs in association with its dimerization partner H4 in a DAXX-dependent manner. As such, it is probable that in certain contexts the PML NBs act as master epigenetic regulators by modulating the intranuclear availability of the H3.3-H4 dimer pool [[161]].

SUMO as a regulator of stemness and cell identity
Epigenetic alterations can influence the process of lineage commitment by manipulating the expression of pleiotropically acting master transcription factors and resulting in heritable changes in the chromatin. In this context, SUMO’s roles in stemness and reprogramming have recently come to the limelight. Investigation of the global levels of SUMO pathway components revealed markedly different expression patterns in progenitor and stem cells compared to their differentiated counterparts, with multiple groups reporting relatively higher sumoylation levels in the former [[142, 153, 162-167]]. The ectopically expressed classical transcription factors that are used for reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are themselves subject to sumoylation (c-MYC [[129, 168, 169]], KLF4 [[170]], SOX2 [[171]], OCT4 [[172]]. In UBC9-depleted iPSC, many of these transcription factors display reduced levels, while in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, UBC9 depletion leads to a concomitant decrease in the iPSC generation efficiency [[167]] These results hint at the critical roles played by the sumoylation system in maintaining the stem cell compartment. In other contexts, sumoylation appears to promote lineage commitment. For instance, evidence from other knockdown studies suggests that SUMO-dependent processes may help conserve cell identity, as SUMO depletion increases the efficiency of reprogramming into pluripotency in specialized cell lines [[153]]. In embryonic stem cells, a similar depletion protocol yields a 2-cell-stage phenotype, ostensibly through a global reduction in the heterochromatin-associated H3K9Me3 modification as discussed above, which could lead to permissive 2-cell-specific gene expression [[153]]. Other SUMO machinery components can also critically control stemness. PIAS1 is a SUMO E3 ligase that can implement epigenetic changes in specific loci to restrict the differentiation of natural regulatory T cells by recruiting silencing factors such as DNA methyltransferases and HP1 [[173]]. In mice, PIAS1 was also reported to act as a switch between hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation and self-renewal by epigenetically silencing the GATA1 transcription factor gene [[174]]. Introducing another layer of complexity is the recent finding of PIAS1 sumoylation, which compromises its function of suppressing IFN-γ signaling [[175]]. While PIAS1 inhibition may be strictly compartmentalized within this immune response context, it would be interesting to investigate the potential effects of higher global sumoylation levels on PIAS1 activity and its implications for maintaining pluripotency in stem cells.

While SUMO oversees stemness, pathways that regulate stemness also wield control over sumoylation, possibly implying the presence of delicately balanced feedback loops. LIN28 acts as a contributing factor for iPSC generation by inhibiting the production of the let-7 family of microRNAs, which negatively regulate pluripotency by targeting stemness factors [[176]]. Let-7 can also impair SUMO availability by targeting the genes for all three paralogs [[142]], suggesting that sumoylation may be a major downstream effector of LIN28 in imposing stemness. IFN stimulation leads to decreased let-7 levels, indirectly increasing SUMO levels to mount an innate response to infection. Note that in other contexts, IFNs can also contribute to stemness [[177]]. Another fascinating aspect of stemness is the presence of resident populations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in many tumors, which can stymie therapeutic efforts by promoting resistance and serving as a constant and renewable source of tumor cells [[178]]. LIN28 can serve as a marker for CSCs, and along with reduced let-7 levels, is associated with poor prognosis in many cancers [[179, 180]]. Not surprisingly, UBC9 and PIAS1 depletion were found to repress CSC phenotype in colorectal and basal breast carcinomas, indicating that SUMO is essential for CSC maintenance [[181]]. Moreover, within the CSC niche, pro-inflammatory cytokines may play a pro-oncogenic role. An analysis of human breast cancer tissue samples revealed an overrepresentation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, as well as cytokines such as IFN-γ [[182]]. Interestingly, PML overexpression can also amplify the IFN-γ response [[183]]. IFNs also strongly enhance PML expression and promote NB biogenesis [[11, 13, 28]]. Thus, IFN-triggered, PML NB-enforced hyper-sumoylation may control stem cell self-renewal. Supporting this idea is the finding that abolishing PML in HSCs leads to their elimination [[184]]. While the mechanism for HSC maintenance was found to involve a PML–PPAR-δ–fatty acid oxidation axis, in light of the abovementioned studies, these findings may also implicate globally reduced sumoylation as a partially responsible mechanism. Taken together, it is possible that these findings constitute an integrated axis of IFN-controlled maintenance of CSCs through sumoylation. As such, therapeutic targeting of sumoylation could be key to eradicating resident CSCs [[181, 185-187]]. Inhibition of the SUMO pathway can also restore chemosensitivity in chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [[188]], or sensitize non-APL AMLs to retinoid-induced differentiation therapy [[189]]. Moreover, the generally consistent roles played by SUMO in maintaining stemness imply that pharmacological manipulation of sumoylation may also be a promising avenue for improving iPSC generation protocols and stem cell-based therapies.

SUMO as a critical regulator of protein stability: implications for neurodegeneration, cancer, and infection
Because proteolysis is highly druggable, one of the most debated biochemical outcomes attributed to sumoylation, that it promotes protein destruction, is now emerging as among the most therapeutically relevant, partly thanks to decades of APL research [[16, 144, 190]]. In the sections above, we discussed the similarities between ubiquitin and SUMO modifications. Within our cells, a major role of ubiquitin is to compose polymers that tag the substrate for proteasomal degradation, preventing the potentially toxic or disruptive accumulation of proteins and recycling them into the cellular amino acid pool. This ubiquitin–proteasome axis constitutes one of the most important functional crossover points between the two PTMs, highlighting the critical importance of sumoylation in proteostasis. In this pathway, substrate poly-sumoylation serves as a signal to recruit STUbLs. Subsequently, the substrate gets poly-ubiquitylated on a neighboring lysine residue and gets degraded via the proteasome. As mentioned above, mixed ubiquitin-SUMO chains have also been reported, though their functions likely vary contextually [[55, 96, 100, 190, 191]].

Initially shown to control subcellular localization [[5, 6, 192]] or transcriptional activity [[35, 36]], sumoylation functionally appeared to be uninvolved in protein stability in its early days. Later work on two critical proteins, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and IκBα (discussed above), revealed the first connection between sumoylation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation, pointing at an antagonistic relationship [[37, 193]]. In retrospect, the very first paper hinting at a role for SUMO in promoting degradation was published by Hugues de Thé’s group [[192]]. APL is a unique model in cancer biology where treatment preceded the discovery of molecular mechanisms [[23, 194]]. Arsenic trioxide, a traditional Chinese medicine, had just been identified as a potent agent that induced remissions in many APL patients and while trying to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of this response, the authors discovered that arsenic-induced degradation of both PML and PML/RARα proteins [[192]]. They also noted the formation of covalently modified high-molecular-weight PML derivatives that preceded degradation [[192]]. In the same year, Hans Will’s group provided evidence for covalent conjugation of PML by SUMO [[195]], and in support of this, later studies identified the high-molecular-weight PML forms as drug-induced SUMO conjugates [[25, 196]], interacting with the STUbL RNF4 [[26, 27]]. Indeed, inhibition of the proteasome leads to the accumulation of proteins that are conjugated with both SUMO and ubiquitin [[197, 198]], extending the synergistic interaction between these two modifiers beyond the APL context. In a similar manner, depletion of RNF4 in human cells results in stabilization of high-molecular-weight SUMO conjugates [[27]]. These findings suggest that proteasome-regulated sumoylation events may be more abundant than initially thought and may even concern large complexes such as the ribosome and the proteasome itself [[199]]. The abovementioned pioneering studies provided the first example of SUMO-mediated protein degradation, connected arsenic-induced sumoylation of PML/RARα to its degradation, and also implied a potential role for PML NBs in facilitating such proteolysis events.

A striking number of proteins involved in a wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer, undergo sumoylation. In light of the recent discoveries that highlight a role for sumoylation in promoting ubiquitylation and degradation, dysregulated sumoylation may contribute to pathogenesis due to altered downstream effects on stability. Similarly, from a therapeutic point of view, manipulation of sumoylation either on a global scale or preferentially in a targeted manner may prove clinically beneficial in specific circumstances (Fig. 3).

Potential modalities to target the sumoylation system. Sumoylation may be artificially targeted in different ways. (A) Global SUMO conjugate levels may be manipulated using pharmacological agents that nonspecifically enhance or impair cellular sumoylation. (B) Left: In substrate-specific manipulation, a bimodal molecule can be employed to artificially bring the substrate together with an endogenous effector protein (UBC9/SENP) within a ternary complex, akin to the PROTAC system. This can lead to specific attachment or detachment of the SUMO protein. Middle: A substrate can alternatively be targeted using a chimeric construct. The construct expresses a substrate-interacting domain that is attached to the effector protein via a linker peptide. Right: UBC9 fusion-directed sumoylation system. The substrate is directly fused to UBC9 to induce its SUMO modification. (C) Sumoylation may be targeted in a locus-specific manner. As depicted, a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) protein can be linked to an effector protein. This chimeric construct is then targeted to a specific locus with the help of a guide RNA molecule (not shown), upon which the effector protein can catalyze SUMO attachment or detachment on chromatin-binding proteins. (D) PML NB biogenesis can be induced using distinct stimuli. ROS, arsenic, IFN, or other stimuli can lead to the formation of PML NBs. This results in the recruitment of partner proteins, which get hyper-sumoylated. As a result, these partners can be degraded via the ubiquitin–proteasome system. As described, other nondegradative outcomes are also possible. ROS, reactive oxygen species.
SUMO in neurodegeneration
In many neurodegenerative disorders, the etiology lies at least partially in the presence of inclusion bodies formed by aggregation-prone constituents. Remarkably, the vast majority of these pathogenic proteins can undergo sumoylation, which likely affects their aggregative tendencies through changes in stability, solubility, or interaction capacity. These proteins include superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) [[200]], TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) [[201]], Tau [[202]], amyloid precursor protein [[203]], α-synuclein [[202, 204]], ataxin-1 [[205]], and Huntingtin [[206]] among others. Despite the seemingly extensive involvement of SUMO in neurodegeneration, functional studies in different model systems have yielded discrepant results, with a detailed model remaining elusive for this PTM in many disorders. While sumoylation seems to have a detrimental effect on certain neurodegenerative conditions, in others, it appears to help with the clearance of the inclusion bodies. For instance, Tau, whose hyperphosphorylated form creates the neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease, undergoes SUMO modification in competition with ubiquitylation, impeding the proteasomal degradation of this toxic protein [[207]]. On the other hand, the toxic polyglutamine (polyQ) protein ataxin-1, which is implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia, undergoes SUMO-targeted ubiquitylation followed by proteasomal degradation [[208]]. Different SUMO paralogs can also result in dissimilar outcomes. These discrepancies are consistent with the diverse roles played by SUMO, such as facilitating or competing with ubiquitylation depending on the substrate. Nevertheless, reducing the stability of toxic misfolded proteins is a key therapeutic goal, and for this purpose, a model of a potentially druggable axis of molecular interactors has emerged, as we hinted earlier. According to this model, PML can selectively recognize misfolded proteins and induce their sumoylation through an E3 ligase activity, which leads to RNF4 binding and ubiquitylation of the target protein, precipitating its proteasomal degradation [[28, 208]]. Indeed, in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1), PML deficiency was found to be associated with aggravated motor defects, with histological correlates in the cerebellum such as significantly reduced Purkinje cell density and molecular layer thickness [[208]]. Studies by another group on SCA7 also point at the roles of PML and SUMO in clearing the toxic aggregates in a proteasome-dependent manner [[209-211]]. Interestingly, IFN-β treatment leads to enhanced clearance of the inclusion bodies in a mouse model, likely due to PML biogenesis [[209]] and enhanced sumoylation [[142]]. These findings point at a drug-responsive pathway that could be therapeutically exploited to resolve certain neurodegenerative disorders.

It should be kept in mind that aside from having dramatically different effects on stability, SUMO may also affect aggregative tendencies of substrates in different ways, such as induction of an amyloidogenic conformation, mediating intracellular trafficking, enabling proximity via SUMO-SIM interactions, or promoting solubility by acting as a hydrophilic tag [[212]]. For instance, sumoylation of purified α-synuclein enhances its solubility [[213]] with a concomitant increase in Parkinson’s disease-associated Lewy body formation in a yeast model with SUMO-deficient α-synuclein [[214]]. Conversely, in the case of Huntingtin, which is implicated in Huntington’s disease (HD), modification by SUMO2 increases aggregation and toxicity [[215]], whereas the deletion of the modified lysines results in reduced pathology [[206]]. The etiology of the HD stems from an expansion in the N-terminal CAG repeat region, which is translated into an extended hydrophilic polyQ stretch that forms clumps. The SUMO modifications occur mainly on the three upstream lysine residues adjacent to this polyQ stretch, namely K6, K9, K11 [[206]]. Thus, poly-sumoylation may aggravate the clumping phenotype by behaving as an extended hydrophilic interface which could stabilize the aggregates through further hydrogen bonding [[216]]. On the other hand, modification by SUMO1 results in a simultaneous increase in both Huntingtin solubility and toxicity [[217]], implying that inclusion body formation does not necessarily contribute to pathogenesis, at least as the primary driver. Other processes that contribute to toxicity, such as intracellular trafficking or heterotypic protein interactions, may also be influenced in different ways depending on the modifying paralog or PTM. However, these processes are not well understood, and a comprehensive model for the pathogenesis of HD and many other neurodegenerative disorders is lacking. Huntingtin gets modified by other PTMs, such as ubiquitylation, acetylation, palmitoylation, and phosphorylation, which are explored more in other reviews [[218]]. Some of these PTMs can also compete for the same lysine residue in the case of Huntingtin, further compounding the difficulty of parsing out SUMO-specific effects [[206]]. In summary, sumoylation may counter or contribute to inclusion body formation depending on which biochemical consequence predominates, such as altered solubility, stability, trafficking, protein–protein interactions, and function. To assess the relative contributions of these often-competing processes to pathogenesis, it is important to clarify the cellular context within which the implicated misfolded protein exists.

SUMO in oncogenesis
The SUMO pathway wields considerable control over cancer-related processes such as cell cycle, senescence, and apoptosis. The initial connection between sumoylation and cancer dates back to the identification of PML and PML/RARα as among the first SUMO substrates, and for this reason, APL serves as the paradigmatic example of tumor suppressor (PML) or oncoprotein (PML/RARα) sumoylation. SUMO has many substrates and functions in cancer, and the consequences of the sumoylation of cancer-related proteins are diverse, ranging from altered transcriptional activity to subcellular localization [[145, 219, 220]]. Along the lines of this emerging topic, it is not surprising that the stabilities of oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins are regulated through sumoylation with pathogenic implications. In this context, sumoylation frequently interacts with ubiquitylation to manipulate the key players. β-Catenin, the transcriptional effector of the growth-promoting WNT signaling pathway, constitutively undergoes ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation in a highly regulated fashion [[221]]. However, upon binding of the WNT ligand to the Frizzled receptor, the WNT destruction complex components get sequestered to the plasma membrane, rendering β-catenin stable and free to induce the transcription of target genes such as MYC that control cell fate and proliferation [[222]]. In myeloma cell lines, modification by SUMO also stabilizes β-catenin by preventing its ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, mimicking the ligand-bound phenotype and thereby favoring pro-oncogenic signaling [[223]]. Indeed, in multiple myeloma patient samples, sumoylation pathway components, as well as SUMO conjugate levels, were found to be markedly upregulated in association with poorer survival outcomes [[224]]. SUMO can also stabilize oncogenic proteins by inactivating their regulatory partners. Solid tumors rely on the creation of new vascular networks to meet their growing nutrient demands. The α-subunit of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1α), similarly to β-catenin, undergoes constitutive ubiquitylation and proteasomal destruction in the cell through the activity of another ubiquitin E3 ligase, the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) [[225]]. Under normoxic conditions, HIF1α is hydroxylated, leading to the formation of binding sites for pVHL. Under hypoxic conditions, on the other hand, such as in the case of ischemia or solid tumor growth, this hydroxylation reaction does not occur, leading to HIF1α stability and enhanced transactivation of its pro-angiogenic target genes [[225]]. In this pathway, SUMO1 can modify pVHL and induce its oligomerization and inactivation, which removes the inhibition of HIF1α signaling [[226]]. Thus, aside from competing with ubiquitin on a given lysine residue, SUMO can hamper ubiquitylation by deactivating specific ubiquitin E3 ligases. Another manner in which sumoylation can lead to increased half-life is illustrated by the case of MYC oncoprotein sumoylation by the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1. According to the proposed model, the resultant SUMO residues on MYC constitute docking sites for the kinase JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) 1, which phosphorylates the protein on serine 62 (S62), and prevent the recruitment of GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta), which phosphorylates threonine 58 (T58) [[227]]. The S62 phosphorylation of MYC mediates its activation, whereas the T58 phosphorylation mediates its degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system [[227]]. Therefore, MYC sumoylation leads to enhanced activation and reduced turnover by altering its interaction partner and PTM profile. Although we mainly focused on the stabilization of oncogenic proteins to illustrate how SUMO stabilizes its targets, SUMO modifications can also lead to the stabilization of anti-oncogenic proteins in similar ways (IκBα: [[37]]; SMAD4: [[228, 229]]; interferon regulatory factor 1: [[230]]; Notch1: [[231]]).

In addition to stabilizing MYC, recent work revealed that sumoylation may cooperate with MYC to maintain oncogenesis. Several groups have identified a synthetic-lethal effect of the SUMO E1 enzyme depletion in MYC-amplified tumors. Explaining this phenomenon is a study by Kessler et al., which suggests that sumoylation helps maintain the transcription of MYC targets that support mitotic fidelity and hence cell viability [[232]]. The authors performed a genome-wide shRNA screen for synthetic-lethal candidates in human mammary epithelial cells overexpressing MYC. They noted that loss of SAE (or its catalytic function) was synthetically lethal with MYC hyper-activation and that cells required a catalytically active SUMO E1 enzyme, and hence sumoylation, to tolerate oncogenic MYC. In another study, MYC was shown to upregulate cellular sumoylation by inducing the expression of SUMO pathway components in MYC-driven B-cell lymphomas [[233]]. Inhibition of sumoylation either by SUMO E1 knockdown or pharmacological means not only impaired the survival and proliferation of MYC-driven lymphoma cells in culture, but also compromised disease maintenance in mice transplanted with MYC-induced lymphomas. Because MYC-driven cancers are notoriously difficult to target, inhibition of sumoylation may alternatively be exploited as a therapeutic strategy in such cases of “nononcogene addiction” to SUMO cascade components. Sumoylation also destabilizes many key players in oncogenesis, mainly by driving interactions with the ubiquitin–proteasome system. While MYC sumoylation can have a stabilizing effect as we discussed above, it also appears to recruit RNF4, leading to ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of this oncoprotein [[129]]. A similar manner of degradation was observed for chromobox protein homolog 2 (CBX2), the overexpression of which is associated with poor survival in several human cancers, following treatment with the HDAC inhibitor SAHA [[234]]. Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is another protein central to carcinogenesis that gets degraded via RNF4 STUbL activity [[235]]. As we discussed above, PML/RARα also gets degraded through the same molecular pathway, which underlies the molecular basis of the cure for APL [[26, 27]]. Interestingly, the HTLV-I oncoprotein TAX, which is the driver protein for ATL, can undergo RNF4 STUbL-mediated degradation in a PML-associated manner upon arsenic/IFN treatment [[143]], highlighting the physiological and therapeutic importance of the drug-responsive PML/SUMO/RNF4 axis described above. While these examples point at a predominantly tumor suppressor role played by RNF4, in SUMO-independent contexts, it also appears to play pro-oncogenic roles, as discussed in a recent review [[236]]. While further research is needed to precisely clarify the involvement of RNF4 in tumorigenesis, given these conflicting roles, targeted induction of oncoprotein poly-sumoylation or promoting RNF4 STUbL activity might be better therapeutic goals than simply increasing global RNF4 availability. For example, IRC117539 is a novel molecule that binds AR and induces its sumoylation [[237]]. How IRC117539 promotes AR sumoylation is unclear, yet the treatment results in sumoylation-dependent degradation of AR by the proteasome, inducing massive loss of viability in AR-dependent prostate cancer cells [[237]]. Finally, sumoylation can also indirectly promote degradation of oncoproteins or tumor suppressors by stabilizing their negative regulators, such as in the case of p53 destabilization arising from sumoylation and consequently enhanced activity of the MDM2 ubiquitin E3 ligase [[238]].

SUMO in infection
As might be gleaned from the case of HTLV-I and TAX, sumoylation has been found to interface with intracellular pathogens. While SUMO can induce the degradation of microbial proteins as part of the innate immune defense, pathogens can disarm the host sumoylation response or hijack it to degrade host proteins [[239]]. The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genome encodes ICP0, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that fulfills a function analogous to STUbLs [[240]]. Following infection, ICP0 selectively degrades host PML, a downstream mediator of the IFN response, to increase infection efficiency [[240, 241]]. A proteomic analysis focused on the global consequences of ICP0 activity following HSV-1 infection revealed a greater than threefold reduction in the stability of 124 SUMO2-modified host proteins, likely to subvert the host antiviral response [[242]]. Along the same lines, Listeria monocytogenes infection was found to impair global sumoylation in epithelial cells through Listeriolysin O toxin activity triggering proteasome-independent degradation of UBC9 [[243]]. In summary, sumoylation regulates the stability of key effectors involved in a diverse range of pathogenic states including neurodegeneration, cancer, and infection.

Conclusion and future perspectives
In this review, we have shared a comprehensive history of the SUMO modification starting from its initial discovery, along with our perspective on the direction toward which the SUMO field is headed. The scientific community at large started to appreciate the importance of this young modification only recently, mainly due to the seemingly contradictory initial findings regarding its purpose. Today, we understand that sumoylation is a multifunctional modification with context-dependent roles. The sumoylation system mediates heterotypic interactions between proteins, the nature of which may depend on their subcellular localization, such as in the case of interactions with the PML NBs. Moreover, SUMO interfaces with, impacts, and can be impacted by other PTMs. Due to these reasons, a full appreciation of SUMO’s roles within a substrate requires a sophisticated understanding of the relevant pathway, as well as the emergent properties that arise from the interactions among the players that are involved. Indeed, SUMO is a relatively recent PTM with no prokaryotic counterpart and thus may be thought of as a signaling system that has evolved to capacitate the complex interactions within the intricate molecular ecosystem of the eukaryotic cell. In accordance with this idea, a large-scale bioinformatic study that comparatively analyzed several PTM types in different eukaryotes identified sumoylation as the fastest-evolving of these [[244]]. Consequently, as we continue to learn about how these interactions operate in health and disease, we are also gaining a better perspective on the nuanced roles played by SUMO.

Several major themes are developing within our field, all of which have a great potential for the development of the next generation of therapies. As we discussed above, sumoylation can modulate the epigenetic landscape to induce or repress the transcription of certain genes as part of functional programs such as development or stress response. Sumoylation and stemness programs are also intimately linked with each other, with mechanisms in place for mutual regulation. Global SUMO levels are higher in progenitor and stem cells compared to their differentiated progeny. In line with this, sumoylation generally appears to favor conservation of stemness and self-renewal rather than differentiation, and this also appears to be the case for CSCs.

We also discussed how sumoylation regulates protein stability, with particular attention to neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and infection. As we pointed out, SUMO is almost universally associated with aggregation-prone proteins. However, it seems to play discrepant roles in the etiologies of the corresponding neurodegenerative disorders, which is likely a reflection of the diverse functional outcomes of sumoylation. As it appears to influence the inclusion body formation through changes in critical features such as stability and solubility, it might be possible to pharmacologically upregulate or downregulate the cell’s sumoylation response to resolve the disease phenotype. SUMO can also positively or negatively influence the stability of many oncoproteins and tumor suppressors, mainly by counteracting or cooperating with the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Lastly, sumoylation is important for the innate immune response against infectious organisms, which in turn can abrogate this response by targeting the host sumoylation system.

Finally, as an emerging topic in the field, we discussed the group sumoylation concept. Accordingly, modification of a modest fraction of the total pool of a target substrate is sufficient for widespread changes in function. Consequently, therapeutic modalities that aim to manipulate the sumoylation machinery may not necessarily need to achieve maximal efficiency to attain desirable outcomes.

Future of SUMO-based therapies
In the sections above, we talked about why the sumoylation system is a good candidate for the development of therapies against a wide range of human diseases. As we see it, these therapies fall under two broad categories: those that achieve therapeutic effects through a global manipulation of the cellular sumoylation system, and those that do so through a specific manipulation of a given substrate’s sumoylation (Fig. 3). The cellular sumoylation system may be nonspecifically disrupted through the use of small molecule inhibitors such as ginkgolic acid or spectomycin B1 that form complexes with the SUMO cascade components [[145]]. Ginkgolic acid is a component of the Ginkgo biloba leaf extract, which is commonly used as a memory enhancing supplement [[245]]. While multiple studies found anti-oncogenic effects of this phenolic compound [[246-249]], ginkgolic acid is also notable for being the first identified chemical inhibitor of sumoylation, acting by interfering with E1-SUMO complex formation [[250]]. Interestingly, a recent publication suggests that the use of ginkgolic acid may be a valid strategy for the clearance of toxic α-synuclein aggregates [[251]]. In a recent mouse study, the same chemical was also shown to induce the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells into adipocytes through the suppression of SUMO conjugation [[252]]. Spectomycin B1, on the other hand, was initially described as an antibiotic-targeting Gram-positive bacteria [[253]] and later revealed to block sumoylation by binding UBC9 and preventing the formation of the UBC9-SUMO complex [[254]]. Conversely, sumoylation may be enhanced through the use of other agents such as IFNs. Nevertheless, due to SUMO’s essential roles in the cell as well as the pleiotropic activity of these agents on multiple pathways, such global approaches may suffer from narrow therapeutic windows and widespread toxicities (Fig. 3A). For example, ginkgolic acid was reported to also target histone acetylation, though possibly at much higher doses than those required for sumoylation inhibition in cells [[250]]. To address this, inhibitors with a greater degree of selectivity such as ML-792 have been developed and are commercially available [[255]]. ML-792 is a potent and selective SAE inhibitor that forms an adduct with SUMO in an ATP-dependent mechanism, similar to the reaction catalyzed by the E1 enzyme itself. Critically, treatment with ML-792 not only impairs SUMO conjugation but also induces significant loss of viability in multiple cancer cell lines, with those that overexpress MYC being particularly hyper-sensitive to the drug [[255]]. This observation is in support of the abovementioned notion that targeting sumoylation in MYC-driven cancers may be a viable treatment strategy.

Alternatively, the SUMO pathway may be manipulated for a given substrate through precise targeting, with potentially lower toxicity. Such an approach, named “proteolysis targeting chimera” (PROTAC), has been developed to drive a given substrate to proteasomal degradation by inducing its poly-ubiquitylation [[256]]. This system relies on a dual-acting small molecule that can simultaneously and reversibly bind a ubiquitin E3 ligase and the target substrate, thereby enforcing their proximity [[257]]. This ensures selective E3 ligase activity on the desired substrate, leading to increased turnover. A similar approach could be developed for the precise manipulation of a SUMO substrate (Fig. 3B, left). In distinction to ubiquitin, SUMO also has multiple paralogs that can modify a target with distinct consequences. Therefore, a SUMO targeting chimera (SUMOTAC?) system could also selectively impose or reverse modifications by a certain paralog by employing small molecules that are able to recruit paralog-specific E3 ligases or SENPs, as identified by high-throughput screening methods. For instance, SENP2 preferentially removes SUMO2, whereas SENP1 mainly acts on SUMO1 [[94]]. Similarly, E3 ligases can also display paralog specificity, with enzymes such as ZNF451 and K-bZIP preferentially catalyzing SUMO2/3 attachment [[99, 258]]. The suitability of these enzymes for such applications can be assessed on SUMO substrates whose functional and biochemical properties are differentially modulated based on the modifying paralog. For instance, SUMO1 modification of α-synuclein increases the protein’s aggregative tendencies, whereas SUMO2 modification yields enhanced solubility [[259]]. Therefore, a dual-acting chemical may be designed to engage a SUMO2/3 specific E3 ligase or SENP1 to force modification by SUMO2 with the purpose of reducing α-synuclein toxicity. This way, while current PROTAC protocols mainly induce ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, a SUMOTAC system could be used to influence a target substrate’s stability, solubility, interactor profile or localization. A similar effect could also be achieved through the use of a chimeric construct that consists of a protein domain that specifically binds the target substrate and a SUMO machinery component that is attached to this protein domain through a linker peptide (Fig. 3B, middle) [[260]]. While these systems are yet to be developed, there is also a system that is currently in use employing a chimeric construct where UBC9 is directly attached to a substrate to specifically induce its sumoylation (Fig. 3B, right) [[261]].

As we pointed out above, sumoylation changes the chromatin landscape by manipulating key epigenetic factors such as chromatin modifiers and histones. A potential method to manipulate chromatin sumoylation in a locus-specific manner could be centered around a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) construct that does not possess any nuclease activity (Fig. 3C). In recent years, multiple chimeric constructs have been generated to induce or suppress the expression of a target gene. These systems feature a dCas9 protein that is attached to a transcriptional effector [[262]]. When this construct is provided exogenously to a cell along with a guide RNA molecule that is complementary to the target DNA sequence, the chimeric construct localizes to this sequence on the chromatin, leading to the manipulation of gene expression. In a similar manner, the dCas9 protein could be attached to UBC9 or a SENP to manipulate sumoylation at a target locus.

Finally, as we discussed extensively, PML NBs are druggable sumoylation factories that provide opportunities for clinical interventions (Fig. 3D). While we currently lack a method to target specific proteins to PML NBs, a robust and generalized induction of PML NB biogenesis by stimuli such as arsenic and IFNs can drive clearance in ATL and APL. The enhanced formation of these structures can precipitate the hyper-sumoylation of the pathogenic substrates, leading to distinct fates such as degradation, sequestration within the PML NBs, changes in activity and modification by other PTMs. Therefore, this treatment modality may also be the answer for many other disorders.
